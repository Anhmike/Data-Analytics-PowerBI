Data analytics using PowerBI for the Silicon Valley Diversity dataset.

Files under this repository include,
1. PowerPoint presentation of the analysis done on the data, questions asked vs questions answered through the data.
2. A picture of the PowerBI dashboard
3. PowerBI dashboard of the data.

You can download the PowerBI dashboard and use it to simulate the outcomes found from doing the analysis.

To get a quick clear view of what I did, please download the siliconvalleyv2.PNG file and open it using your picture viewer, then further more you can explore the SiliconDiversity.pptx powerpoint presentation to see what questions were asked and their answers using the data. To view the PowerBI dashboard you will need a Microsoft PowerBI tool installed on your laptop/computer.
